Composer Installer for Aura System
==================================

Using this installer, all [Composer][] packages of `"type" : "aura-package"`
will be installed under `package/Vendor_Name.Package_Name` (note the
directory, capitalization, and punctuation). This is a layout specific to the
[Aura system][].

Aura packages **do not** need to be installed in a particular location when
used outside of an Aura system. If you install an `aura-package` without this
installer, the package will be installed to the default Composer location of
`vendor/vendor_name/package_name`. As such, if you are not building an Aura
system, you probably don't need this installer.

Note that this is not an Aura package proper; it is designed for use directly
with Composer, and as such will be placed in `vendor` not `package`.
